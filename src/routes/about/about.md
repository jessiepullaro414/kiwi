This is a tool that is being build for SHAPE. SHAPE is a hackathon club at
Florida Polytechnic University. The reason this tool is being built is do to
the lack of structure in Workshops overall. As a whole it is hard to find the
information that a workshop covers after the event. This is the best thing a
group of programmers could think of that would give us full control of content
and would be fun.

The big goals of this is to have a place where all of the workshops that are
made can be added and indexed. This will also enable us to have a place to
point people if they want to go over a workshop after the event.

We have some fun things planed for this.

This is and open source project and that is for a good reason. We want your help.
Hit us up on Github and we will gladly get you in on this project.
